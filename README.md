### Tasks to implement:

1. When you hold down the left mouse button over the square and move the mouse, the square moves behind the mouse;
2. Right-click changes the color of the square from the list of available colors;
3. Shift + left mouse button reduces the size of the square (by adding / publishing the `.box-large` class);
4. Double-click left mouse button creates another square, which has the same functionality as previous. Each new square must have a unique number;
5. Alt + double-click left mouse button deletes a square (the last square on the page should not be deleted).
